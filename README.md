# Codecademy Mixed Messages Project

When life's got you down, nothing makes you feel even crappier than an abnoxious stoic message, delivered by randomness.

1. What's wrong?

    It doesn't even really matter. We'll generate an ailment for you.

2. What's the most abnoxious advice we could think of?

    You'll find it, here!

3. Who said it?

    Meh, some random stoic philosopher. We'll randomly generate one here to make it seem legit.

Have a nice day!
